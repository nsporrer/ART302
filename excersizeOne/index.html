        <h1>Disc Golf Discs</h1>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>
            There are three broad categories of disc golf discs. Each of these disc types have certain advantages and disadvantages.<br><br>
            Here are the three main types:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Putters</li>
            <li>Mid-Ranges</li>
            <li>Drivers</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Disc Flight Paths:</h2>

        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            As you can see in the image, putters are designed to fly straight, but not super far. Mid-ranges are designed to go farther than putters 
            but with a little sacrifice to accuracy. Drivers can be thrown the longest, but they will hardly ever go straight, making them the hardest 
            disc to learn how to throw.
            <br><br>
            Within each of the three broad categories of discs there are more sub categories. Some discs go left on their own, some right, and some 
            relatively straight. <a href="https://blog.infinitediscs.com/overstable-vs-understable/">Click here</a> to learn more about further classifying of discs.
